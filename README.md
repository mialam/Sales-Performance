  I developed an Excel-based sales performance dashboard to analyze patterns and trends from 2017 to 2019. This project aimed to enhance the way sales data was tracked, interpreted, and utilized for decision-making. By replacing traditional static reports with a more interactive and visually intuitive dashboard, I enabled a deeper understanding of sales performance across different periods.
  
Leveraging Excelâ€™s advanced data analysis and visualization capabilities, the dashboard provided both high-level summaries and the flexibility to drill down into specific data points. This allowed for a more comprehensive examination of sales trends, helping to identify growth opportunities, forecast future demand, and refine sales strategies.

One of the key features of the dashboard was its ability to track the top-selling products within various categories. By analyzing historical data and identifying consistent bestsellers, the tool played a crucial role in optimizing inventory management. This insight guided procurement decisions, ensuring that high-demand products were prioritized for future stock replenishment, ultimately improving overall sales efficiency.
